 A presenter is a concrete generic class that, given a specific View and a 
 specific ViewModel, is able to update the view in accordance to the 
 viewModel. When a `Presenter` is used, the ViewControllerObserver can be 
 downgraded as simple `ViewModelHolder` and let the `Presenter` the 
 responsability to bind and make up the UI. Keep in mind that a Presenter, 
 as it is, is not storing neither the view or the viewModel. This decision 
 is entirely left to the developer to best fit any project.

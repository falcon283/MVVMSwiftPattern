 An object conforms the `ViewModelHolder` is forced to keep a reference of 
 a specific instance of ViewModel. A tipical `ViewModelHolder` is a
 ViewController. Doing this, all the *Massive* logic tipical of the MVC 
 is moved away from the ViewController to the specific ViewModel. 
 At this point the ViewController will need to focus just on the UI and the
 User Interaction redirecting that user actions to the suitable function
 of the ViewModel.
